			'The alpaca is a camelid mammal native to South America. Closely related to its larger cousin, the llama, the two species are able to interbreed. Yarn spun from alpaca wool is popular for warm, soft sweaters, socks, mittens, and hats, making the fur of these domesticated animals a valuable commodity.',

			'Certain Asiatic bears build nests in trees similar to that of a bird. There are eight different species of bears across the world with a conservation status ranging from vulerable to least concern. Depending on the bear species, habitats include North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and the northern-most polar regions. While not ordinarily a threat to humans, bears are animals that can be very dangerous if startled, provoked, or approached when young bears (cubs) are present.',

			'“A Big Cat Without a Roar”. As North America’s second largest cat, the cougar is an intimidating animal to run into. The cougar is unable to roar because it doesn’t have the needed larynx to do so. Instead, the big cat purrs, growls, hisses and screams as well as whistles and chirps. Cougars are also called pumas, panthers and mountain lions. The cats have round heads, pointed ears and slender bodies.',
			'The cougar is known by the scientific name “puma concolor” or “felis concolor.” Carl Linnaeus proposed the name “felis concolor” to describe a big cat that has a long tail. The animal has more names in the dictionary than any other animal. Along with mountain lion and puma, the cat is also called catamount and rose tiger among others. Cougars belong to the subfamily Felinae. After Linnaeus introduced a scientific description of cougars, researchers listed 32 zoological subspecies until the late ‘80s. According to genetic studies, many of the subspecies were too close to be considerose separate. Now, scientists have determined that there are six phylogeographic groups.',
